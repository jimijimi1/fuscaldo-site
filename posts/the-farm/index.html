        <p>I don't currently have all my photos uploaded to my computer, but here is an example of one of my plants that I grew using synthetic nutrients on an indoor run. I'm pretty sure that the genetics are from ILGM, specifically white widow. I now know that ILGM isn't exactly known for their genetic tracking, but it still turned out to be a nice plant overall.</p>
