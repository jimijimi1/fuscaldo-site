                <h3><u>8/28/2025 00:00 - Official Notice of New Improvements</u></h3>
                <p>It is official! The updates and news page is live! This allows me to provide detailed explanations of anything that changes or plans of thigns to come. I also updated the design of the "back to home" button, it used to be fixed at the bottom of each page but it is now pinned to the top left of each page. This is more of an aesthetic change than function, but I can see it becoming useful once the paged start filling out.</p>
                <p>In the coming weeks, I would like to format each page to make them a bit more digestable. As it stands, the entire site is maroon red with white text (not exactly award winning design but it gets the job done) I would like to start chaging the vibe of each page accoring to the contents.</p>
                <p>As breifly as I can, here is what I would like to do for the current pages; Wrist Watching will soon include my entire collection and detailed infaormation about each watch; The Farm will soon include as many of my previos grows that I have documented; Mark's Delusions will be added to, there is never a shortage of baffling ideas from that man's mouth.</p>
                <p>I look forward to keeping you all in the loop!</p>
