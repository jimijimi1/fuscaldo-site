                <h3><u>8/8/2025 01:30 - Updated Welcome Page</u></h3>
                <p>I figured this was important enough to warrant it's own update post. I changed the weird old blue-link style that the home page links used to be to the fancy new ones so that they no longer leave a weird first impression. The links are easier to read and aesthetically match the rest of the site. I imagine this will go mostly unnoticed, but the quality of life that this improves is quite a bit.</p>

                <h3><u>8/8/2025 00:00 - Major Watch Time Overhaul!</u></h3>
                <p>I finally decided to update and polish the watch time page. It now at least shows you the watches in question. You will notice that there are also now links to even deeper pages into watch time, these pages are not yet fully functional, but that should be changed within the month. (sub-update 8/8/2025 00:09 - I got the pages to run and I placed a return to parent-page button at the top right.)</p>

                <p>In other notable news, I was able to get an email working for the domain! If you would like to email me to let me know about any spelling issues or any other site issues, or if you just need a friend ;), feel free to send me a message! ==> jimi@fuscaldo.org</p>

                <p>It was brought to my attention that everything was stuck to the left, that is fixed now.</p>

                <h3><u>8/28/2025 10:30 - Added 'The Avian Station'!!!</u></h3>
                <p>Finally! A place for me to share all of my bird related content. Currently, only the livestream of the bird feeder is available but I plan on adding plenty of more fascinating ornithilogical content in the coming months. This also serves as a reminder to not forget to call your .html files 'index' and not the name of the post.</p>
            <br>
                <p>Also, changed the color of borders on the updates page from white to gold because it is less abrasive to the eyes.</p>

                <h3><u>8/28/2025 00:00 - Official Notice of New Improvements</u></h3>
                <p>It is official! The updates and news page is live! This allows me to provide detailed explanations of anything that changes or plans of things to come. I also updated the design of the "back to home" button, it used to be fixed at the bottom of each page but it is now pinned to the top left of each page. This is more of an aesthetic change than function, but I can see it becoming useful once the pages start filling out.</p>
            <br>
                <p>In the coming weeks, I would like to format each page to make them a bit more digestable. As it stands, the entire site is maroon red with white text (not exactly award winning design but it gets the job done) I would like to start chaging the vibe of each page accoring to the contents.</p>
            <br>
                <p>As briefly as I can, here is what I would like to do for the current pages; Wrist Watching will soon include my entire collection and detailed information about each watch; The Farm will soon include as many of my previous grows that I have documented; Mark's Delusions will be added to, there is never a shortage of baffling ideas from that man's mouth.</p>
            <br>
                <p>I look forward to keeping you all in the loop!</p>
